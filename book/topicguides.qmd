Written by [LIBER](https://libereurope.eu/) professionals working in research libraries across Europe, each guide provides a short introduction to practical applications of digital scholarship and data science to the work of libraries today. In each guide, authors share their personal recommendations for useful tutorials, recommended reading, and communities of practice to help colleagues on their learning journey.

  <div class="card-body">The guides aim to be a useful first point of entry into complex topics in digital scholarship and data science and their application in the library world. They are not meant to be read in any particular order and learners are invited to jump in and out of individual guides as personal curiosity or practical need dictates. 

Each _DS Topic Guide_ is designed to make it easy to quickly find the information you might need: 

- Introduction to the topic
- Relevance to the library sector (case studies/use cases)
- Hands-on activities and other self-guided tutorial(s)
- Recommended reading & viewing
- Finding Communities of Practice</div>
